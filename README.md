## Problem Breakdown & Computational Thinking
Why did i choose bubblesort? Bubble Sort works so well that I chose it because it is one of the easiest sorting algorithms I can start to implement and understand. It works in very simple logic: compare those adjacent elements, then swap the elements if they are not in the right order. That makes it perfect for describing basic sorts, comparisons, swaps, iterative passes through a list. Even though Bubble Sort is not efficient with extensive data set at first glance (due to its time complexity of n squared), it is frequently used in introductory programming exercises since the algorithm can be easily traced from one end and debugged and modified. And its simplicity ensures that it is a useful jumping-off point before you master anything similar to merge sort or quicksort.

### Decomposition
- Take a list of integers
- Compare adjacent elements
- Swap if they are out of order
- Repeat until the list is sorted

### Pattern Recognition
- Repeated comparisons between neighbouring values
- Larger values "bubble" toward the end of the list

### Abstraction
- Only comparisons and swaps are shown
- Internal loop counters are hidden from the user

### Algorithm Design
- Input: comma-separated list of integers
- Processing: Bubble Sort algorithm
- Output: step-by-step explanation and sorted list

(Flowchart can be drawn using these steps.)
