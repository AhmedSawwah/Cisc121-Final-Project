## Problem Breakdown & Computational Thinking

### Decomposition
- Take a list of integers
- Compare adjacent elements
- Swap if they are out of order
- Repeat until the list is sorted

### Pattern Recognition
- Repeated comparisons between neighbouring values
- Larger values "bubble" toward the end of the list

### Abstraction
- Only comparisons and swaps are shown
- Internal loop counters are hidden from the user

### Algorithm Design
- Input: comma-separated list of integers
- Processing: Bubble Sort algorithm
- Output: step-by-step explanation and sorted list

(Flowchart can be drawn using these steps.)
